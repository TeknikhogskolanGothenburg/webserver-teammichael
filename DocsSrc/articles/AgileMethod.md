# An agile method

Describe an agile development method, max 1000 words, examples:

* Scrum is somehow a framework that is divided in small parts for the process to get going, in that way it boost the amount
of productive time available for getting useful work done. The process goes as following: There is a Product Owner that decides what to build,
and there is a Development Team that builds it, and further on the Costumers use the software and experience it. Once the software is in the 
Costumers hands it can be valuated and feedback will be sent from costumer and Collaborators/Partners to the Product Owner. A priotity list with features
and news is made from all types of feedback and is called "Product Backlog". In a more defined picture of Scrum there is a "Scrum Master" that
deals with all the rutines and help the Product Owner and Development Team to maintain good work. The Scrum Master works in a cycle of "sprints"
wich usually have a 2 weeks duration and proceeds to make a "sprint plan" togeather with the Product Owner and Dev Team. The high priority items
are selected from the "Backlog" that the Dev Team can make in one sprint, and that is called a "sprint backlog". During that sprint time, each day
a daily Scrum meeting is held to talk about things that have been done and whats next to do and so on.
