# An agile method

Describe an agile development method, max 1000 words, examples:

* Scrum is somehow a framework that is divided in small parts for the process to get going, in that way it boost the amount
of productive time available for getting useful work done. The process goes as following: There is a Product Owner that decides what to build,
and there is a Development Team that builds it, and further on the Costumers use the software and experience it. Once the software is in the 
Costumers hands it can be valuated and feedback will be sent from costumer and Collaborators/Partners to the Product Owner. A priotity list with 
features and news is made from all types of feedback and is called "Product Backlog". In a more defined picture of Scrum there is a "Scrum Master" 
that deals with all the rutines and help the Product Owner and Development Team to maintain good work. The Scrum Master works in a cycle of "sprints"
wich usually have a 2 weeks duration and proceeds to make a "sprint plan" togeather with the Product Owner and Dev Team. The high priority items
are selected from the "Backlog" that the Dev Team can make in one sprint, and that is called a "sprint backlog". During that sprint time, each day
a daily Scrum meeting is held to talk about things that have been done and whats next to do and so on. At the end of the sprint the completed
work is summarized and ready for a release. With the completed work a "sprint review" is made so that the Develpoment Team can demonstrate
new functionality and how the software works to the Collaborators/Partner and Product Owner. Then there is also a "Sprint Retrospective" that comes 
along with the completion of the sprint, the Dev Team can talk about what went well, what didn't go so good and what could improve even more. 
The end of the Sprint Retrospective is to make sure that the next sprint is more efficient and effective than the last one.

* XP Stands for Extreme Programming, "XP is a lightweight methodology for small to medium sized teams developing software in the face of vague or
rapidly changing requirements". - Kent Beck, the software engineer and creator of XP. It can be explained short in a few number of parts:
1. It is "Lightweight" because it doesn't overburden the developers in the process so the process is kept to a minimum.
2. It is also "Humanistic" in terms that the costumers and developers are in the center of the process. 
3. "Pair Programming" where two people use one computer and sitting side by side, and can learn from one another, share ideas and so are better
codes produced.
4. "Code Review" that documents all the work and make sure its a clean code, this needs a review team that can come with suggestions and keep the
process going.
5. "Unit Testing" test the small parts of the code so the program have higher number of small focused functions.
6. "Intergration Testing" is where the software is tested by the dev group in parts. When all parts have been tested there should be no room for
mistakes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Devops is a word for "Development" and "Operations" that is a practice that aims at unifying Software development (Dev) and software Operations
(Ops). It uses costumer-centric teams that can hold diffrent priorities and still work together and get no errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Kanban can be explained, simple factory: just two machines. In ideal world, the machines operate at the same pace, and work flows smoothly from 
"To do" to "Done". But what if Machine 1 is faster  A pile of widgets builds up in front of Machine 2. This "Work in Progress" pile is a problem. 
There are obvious costs: there's money tied up in each of these items. and the physical space that this "queue" takes up also has to be paid for. 
And there are less obvious costs. Like a high tide over a rocky shore, a generous helping of work in progress can hide a multitude of sins, 
including: machine downtime set-up time and quality issues Reduce the Work in Progress, and these hidden issues become issues that can be - need to
be - addressed. Kanban Card ------- But how By having Machine 1 process items ONLY when  Machine 2 is ready to receive it. 
Machine 2 needs to signal to Machine 1 that it's ready; the signal is in the form of the now-famous "Kanban card". No longer are widgets PUSHED 
through the factory. The are now PULLED. The Kanban system was born in the factories of Toyota but has found favour in software development: 
We don't have machines, but we do have processes. We don't process widgets, but  we do process tasks. And we can represent the processes and tasks 
on a board. In this case, the PULL system is implemented without the need for a Kanban Card: an empty (or nearly empty) column is the SIGNAL to 
the previous column to "send more tasks". With low Work in Progress come the advantages of: Shorter cycle times Faster throughout And less wasted 
time

Agile Softwear Development 

To define Agile Softwear Development it is important to know it's use of methods wich it's based on. 
Agile means is the ability to create and respond to changes in order to succeed in an uncertain and turbulent enviroment. 
Therefore Agile Softwear development means is an umbrella term for a set methods and practices based on the values and principles 
expressed in the Agile menifesto. If so, it is also important to know what Agile menifesto is ( www.agilealliance.org ).  
The following explaines Agile software menifesto: 


individuals and interactions over processes and tools	
Working Softwear over comprehensive documentation 
Customer Collaboration over contact negotiation
Responding to Change over following 

The following tweleve principles är based om Agile softwear Development. 
 
Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Working software is the primary measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
( http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html ). 



Agile Softwear Development advocates  also adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, 
and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change  (http://www.its-all-design.com/business-analyst-designer-method/ ).
